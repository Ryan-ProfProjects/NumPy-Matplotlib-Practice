# NumPy-Matplotlib-Practice
This repository contains code and resources for the video tutorials posted on YouTube about learning NumPy and Matplotlib from scratch. In these tutorials, we dive into the basics of Python, NumPy, and Matplotlib to explore row and column vectors, matrices, some matrix multiplication, and 3D plotting with numpy linspaces. I have included the 2nd video about indexing, spending 30 minutes to throroughly explain the nature of lists and arrays. This reposotory will be updated after more videos are made. Soon we will have the tools to create a nueral network ourselves using only NumPy and Matplotlib.
